# Basics-Of-Assembly

I learn how to write programs in Assembly, beacuse of RE. 

# add_values_from_user_input.asm
(My first assembly program)
This program basically waiting for two values from user. When it is done, assembly program will print a result below.

# calculator.asm
(My second assembly program)
After I got some knowledge about arithmetic in Assembly I thought that write a simple calculator is a good idea so I do this. My program has a four main options which it can do with integers from keyboard:
1) Addition
2) Subtraction
3) Multiplication
4) Divide
User can type two numbers. My calculator doesn't support float values now, but maybe I will add this feature in the future.
